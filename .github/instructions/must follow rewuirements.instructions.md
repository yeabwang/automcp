Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

Each time when we work together we have to adhere to
Critical Requirements:
✅ Industry Standard - Following OpenAPI, MCP, and security best practices
✅ Production Ready - Robust error handling, validation, comprehensive logging
✅ Very Secure - PII scrubbing, auth extraction, capability classification
✅ Very Rich - Full context for AI agents (complexity, user_context, examples)
✅ Robust - Handle edge cases, multiple auth schemes, complex schemas
And also please I want the system to be robust so no hardcoded, rulebased things also. 
No spontanous fixes before you do anything, think like an expert software enginer and software arc, read and search well before you add or remove anything
